    <h1>Research Interests</h1>

    <h2>1. How do warmer, wetter winters affect water quality in the Northeast?</h2>
    <p>At UVM, I am part of a team lead by Carol Adair and Andrew Schroth learning how the warmer, wetter winters now common in Vermont due to climate change impact ecosystem health and resilience. Specifically, we want to learn how watershed nutrient cycling is changed with frequent winter melt, flood, and rain-on-snow events. See https://www.vermontpublic.org/local-news/2024-02-21/research-suggests-winter-rain-is-impacting-water-quality-in-vermont</p>

    <h2>2. Are fracking waste injection wells impacting water quality around Columbus, OH?</h2>
    <p>I advised a local community rights group, Columbus Community Bill of Rights, on their water quality monitoring effort in the Scioto watershed which provides drinking water for the Columbus area and is home to numerous disposal wells containing radioactive fracking waste. See their published research at https://columbusbillofrights.org/2023-water-quality-monitoring-survey/</p>

    <h2>3. How is warming-fueled ocean oxygen loss affecting carbon and nitrogen cycling?</h2>

    <h2>4. How is organic matter transformed in the lower Amazon River?</h2>
